## Standards

- **Color coding:** Blue cells = hardcoded inputs · Green cells = cross-sheet links · Black = formulas
- **No circular references** — interest calculated on beginning-of-period balances
- **Audit trail** — all assumptions documented on dedicated tab
- **IB-style formatting** — headers, borders, and number formats match sell-side deliverable standards
