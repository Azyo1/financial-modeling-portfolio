## Q1: Walk me through the blended valuation. Why 40% DCF and 60% comps — that's an unusual weighting.

The 40/60 weighting reflects Ferrari's nature as a luxury brand more than an operating company in the traditional sense. A pure DCF undervalues the franchise because it only captures free cash flows — it can't capture the optionality embedded in the brand, the waitlist, or the pricing power that isn't yet in the P&L.

Luxury goods companies are almost universally valued on multiples, not DCF, for this reason. Hermès, LVMH, Richemont — sell-side covers all of them with EV/EBITDA as the primary methodology. DCF is used to triangulate or stress-test, not as the anchor. I mirror that convention.

I weight DCF at 40% to prevent the blended PT from being entirely multiple-dependent — it grounds the number in actual cash flow generation. But the comps method deserves majority weight because that's how sophisticated investors in luxury goods actually price these assets. A blended 40/60 is more conservative than straight comps; a straight comps approach at 27× gives you $498.

## Q2: Why 27× EV/EBITDA? That seems rich given Ferrari is currently trading at ~22×.

27× is not a stretch — it's a return to where Ferrari traded before EV sentiment weighed on the stock. Ferrari consistently held 28–35× EBITDA multiple through 2022–2023. The compression from ~32× to ~22× wasn't driven by any deterioration in fundamentals — EBITDA margins expanded from 35% to 38.8% over that period, and management just raised long-term targets to 40%+. The de-rating is purely narrative: the market applied a generic EV-transition risk discount.

My comp range: Hermès at ~30×, LVMH at ~14×. Ferrari belongs in the Hermès bucket — single brand, constrained supply, pricing power, multi-year waitlists. Even at 27×, I'm pricing Ferrari at a discount to Hermès. The question is whether the market re-rates back toward 25–30× as the Luce narrative replaces the EV-fear narrative. I think it does, and Q4 2026 Luce deliveries is the catalyst.

**If you push back to 25×:** PT drops to ~$460 blended. Still well above current price. My 27× is not a heroic assumption.

## Q3: Your DCF alone gives $351 but the price target is $450. Aren't you just betting on multiple expansion?

Partially, yes — and I'm explicit about it. The honest framing is: the DCF establishes a *floor*, and the comps establish the *upside*.

The DCF floor matters for two reasons: (1) it tells you the downside is limited — you have $25 of risk to DCF support from current levels of $375, vs. $75+ of upside to the PT; and (2) it proves the business generates enough cash to justify the multiple. A 27× multiple on a company with thin FCF generation is faith-based. A 27× multiple on a company generating €1.5B+ of annual FCF on a near-debt-free balance sheet is defensible.

The re-rating from ~22× to 27× is not speculative — it's a mean reversion from a discount applied for the wrong reason. The Luce removes the EV-fear overhang that caused the de-rating. Once the market sees Ferrari's first EV priced above fleet ASP and delivering margin expansion rather than compression, the BMW comparison breaks down and the Hermès comparison reasserts itself.

## Q4: Why is Ferrari's beta 0.75? It's listed as an auto company. Auto sector betas are 1.1–1.3.

The beta should reflect actual revenue sensitivity to macro conditions, not the SIC code. Ferrari's revenue is not correlated with the auto cycle in any meaningful way.

Here's the proof: in 2020 (COVID), global auto sales dropped 16%. Ferrari deliveries declined ~10% — and EBITDA still grew because they raised prices. In 2022 (inflation spike, consumer confidence at 10-year low), Ferrari grew revenue 19% and EBITDA 31%. The business has essentially zero correlation with consumer cyclicality because demand always exceeds supply and the waitlist absorbs volatility.

The correct peer for beta estimation is the luxury goods sector, not autos. Hermès has a trailing beta of approximately 0.65–0.75. Richemont is around 0.80. These companies share Ferrari's demand structure — aspirational brand, constrained supply, pricing power. Using an auto-sector beta of 1.2 on Ferrari is a category error that would undervalue the business by $50–70/share in the DCF alone.

## Q5: What happens to your thesis if the Luce is delayed past Q4 2026?

The Luce is not load-bearing in my base case. I model only 500 units in FY2027E — conservative enough that a 12-month delay shifts my PT by approximately $8–12/share, bringing it to $438–442. Still well above current price, still OVERWEIGHT.

What I would lose is the sentiment catalyst that drives multiple re-rating. The re-rating is the bigger Luce impact — not the 500-unit revenue contribution (which is €200–250M at most), but the narrative shift from "EV risk" to "EV premium." If the Luce is delayed, the narrative shift is also delayed, and the multiple stays compressed longer.

**The floor case without the Luce:** FY2026E management guidance is €3.0–3.1B EBITDA. At 22× (current depressed multiple, no re-rating), that's ~€66B TEV → ~$78B USD → ~$430/share. So even with no multiple expansion and no Luce contribution, the fundamentals at current multiples support a value near or above current price. That's the definition of an asymmetric trade.

## Q6: Ferrari is down 28% from its high. Why is now the right entry point versus waiting for more clarity?

Because the pullback is narrative-driven, not earnings-driven. FY2025A came in at record 38.8% EBITDA margin. Revenue grew 7%. EPS of €8.96 beat expectations. Management raised long-term margin targets to 40%+. Every fundamental data point improved while the stock fell from $519 to $375. That's a sentiment disconnect, not a business deterioration.

Narrative-driven corrections have a specific anatomy: they persist until a concrete counter-narrative emerges. The Luce reveal on February 9, 2026 — Ferrari's first EV, designed by Jony Ive, priced above fleet ASP — is exactly that counter-narrative. The market now has evidence that Ferrari's EV strategy is premium positioning, not margin compression. The sentiment catalyst has already occurred. Waiting for "more clarity" at this point means waiting until the stock has already recovered.

The risk of waiting: Ferrari's waitlist order book means revenue is visible 18–24 months out. There is no quarterly earnings miss on the horizon that justifies further downside. The risk/reward gets worse every week the stock recovers.

## Q7: Walk me through your EUR/USD assumption. How sensitive is the PT to currency?

Base case is EUR/USD of 1.18, reflecting the rate as of February 2026. All EUR-denominated cash flows and intrinsic value are converted at that rate.

A move from 1.18 to 1.05 — roughly the 2022 low when the dollar was at a 20-year high — would reduce my USD PT by approximately $28–30/share, bringing the blended target from $450 to ~$420. Still above current price, still OVERWEIGHT.

**Natural hedge:** Ferrari generates approximately 25% of revenue in USD (North American sales, some export markets). That provides partial natural hedging — a stronger dollar inflates USD-denominated revenue even as it reduces the conversion rate on EUR-denominated profits. The net currency sensitivity is lower than a pure EUR-revenue company.

The more important currency question is: what does sustained dollar strength signal about global macro? Strong dollar typically accompanies risk-off environments, which could weigh on luxury multiples broadly. I'd monitor EUR/USD less as a direct P&L input and more as a macro signal.

## Q8: What's your bear case and what gets you there?

**Bear case: $295–315/share.** Requires three things simultaneously:

1. **Luxury demand slowdown** — particularly in China (~10% of deliveries) and Middle East, driven by a hard landing or sustained geopolitical risk. Global luxury EBITDA declines 10–15% from planned levels.
2. **Luce delays with cost overruns** — EV platform costs hit margins in FY2026 before Luce revenue arrives, compressing EBITDA margins from 38.8% back toward 36–37%.
3. **Multiple refuses to re-rate** — market durably prices Ferrari at 18–20× EBITDA, treating it as an auto company permanently. No recovery even with strong fundamentals.

Any one of these in isolation: thesis survives. Two simultaneously: uncomfortable but PT still above $350. All three: the DCF floor ($351) also breaks because the margin assumption is wrong, and you're looking at $290–310.

The bear case floor is the key question to defend. I'd argue $290–310 is the realistic worst case because Ferrari's order book provides 18–24 months of revenue visibility regardless of spot demand. A demand shock shows up in deliveries in 2028, not 2026.

---

## Q9: If Ferrari is so great, why not just own Hermès instead? Cleaner story, same luxury thesis.

Hermès is a better business. I'd agree with that. But it's already priced like a better business — at 30× EBITDA with essentially zero re-rating catalyst visible in the next 12 months.

Ferrari offers Hermès-like operational characteristics — pricing power, constrained supply, multi-year waitlists, aspirational positioning — at a 22× multiple, with a specific near-term catalyst (Luce deliveries, Q4 2026) that Hermès doesn't have. You're paying 27% less per dollar of EBITDA for operationally similar business quality, plus you get a free option on the Luce narrative inflecting.

The trade is: own Ferrari now at the discount, let the re-rating close the gap toward Hermès comps, exit when the Luce narrative is fully priced in (roughly 27–30×). That's a 25–40% return with a defined catalyst and a cash flow floor. Hermès at 30× has lower upside and no specific catalyst.

I'd own both. But if forced to choose one for the next 18 months, Ferrari has better risk/reward.

## Q10: What would make you change your rating to Neutral or Underweight?

Three specific triggers:

1. **FY2026E EBITDA comes in below €2.8B** — management guided €3.0–3.1B. A miss below €2.8B implies the margin expansion thesis is reversing, not continuing toward 40%. That would require me to cut my forward EBITDA estimates and the comps-derived PT falls meaningfully.

2. **Luce delivered at pricing below current fleet ASP** — if Ferrari prices Luce at €300–350K (below the ~€400K blended ASP) to drive volume, the thesis inverts: EV becomes a margin headwind, not an ASP accelerant. This is the exact scenario the bear case is built on and exactly what I'd be monitoring at Q4 2026 delivery events.

3. **Multiple re-rating fails despite strong fundamentals** — if by Q2 2027, Ferrari is reporting €3.1B+ EBITDA, delivering Luce units, and the stock is still at 20–22×, the market is making a structural judgment that Ferrari is an auto company regardless of fundamentals. That would require a fundamental reassessment of the comp framework. If the market won't re-rate, the blended PT drops to ~$380 and the risk/reward no longer justifies OVERWEIGHT.
