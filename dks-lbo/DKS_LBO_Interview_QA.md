## Q1: Why does higher leverage increase IRR?

Higher leverage increases IRR because it shrinks the equity check while leaving the total enterprise value creation unchanged.

At 5.5x leverage on this deal, you write a **$5.9B equity check** instead of $8B+ at lower leverage. The debt is a fixed claim — it gets repaid and stops participating in upside. Everything above that fixed claim flows entirely to equity. So when enterprise value grows from $15.3B at entry to $28.2B at exit, that $12.9B of value creation is divided by a $5.9B denominator instead of a larger one. Smaller equity in, same absolute dollar gain = higher MOIC and IRR.

**The intuition:** It's like buying a house with 20% down versus 50% down. Same house, same appreciation. But your return on the cash you put in is much higher when you used more leverage.

**The flip side:** Leverage amplifies losses identically. If enterprise value *falls*, the equity absorbs 100% of the hit — and at high leverage levels that can mean a wipeout or default before debt holders take any losses.

## Q2: What happens if exit multiple compresses?

Multiple compression is the most common IRR killer in LBOs — but EBITDA growth and debt paydown are your cushion.

**In this deal, the cushion is substantial:**

| Exit Multiple | Exit TEV | Net Debt at Exit | Equity Proceeds | MOIC | IRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10.5x (base) | $28.2B | $5.5B | $22.5B | 3.8x | ~30% |
| 9.0x | $24.2B | $5.5B | $18.4B | 3.1x | ~25% |
| 7.0x | $18.8B | $5.5B | $13.1B | 2.2x | ~18% |
| 6.0x | $16.1B | $5.5B | $10.4B | 1.7x | ~12% |

The deal survives a **3.5-turn compression** (10.5x → 7.0x) and still returns ~18% IRR. That resilience comes from two sources:
1. **EBITDA grew 58%** over the hold — $1.7B to $2.7B. A lower multiple is applied to a much bigger EBITDA base.
2. **$3.4B of debt was swept** — net debt dropped from $9.4B to $5.5B, adding directly to equity proceeds regardless of exit multiple.

**What actually kills the deal:** Compression *and* flat EBITDA simultaneously. If the private label thesis fails (margins stay at 13%, EBITDA barely grows) *and* multiples compress to 7x, there's no offset — you're taking a double hit on enterprise value with no debt paydown cushion.

## Q3: What is the biggest risk in this deal?

**Primary risk: The private label thesis doesn't materialize.**

The deal's margin expansion story — 13% EBITDA margins growing to 16.5% over 5 years — is the single biggest driver of returns. It requires consumers to meaningfully shift wallet share from national brands (Nike, Adidas, Under Armour) to DKS's own DSG and Alpine Design labels.

If brand loyalty proves stickier than expected and private label penetration stalls at 15%, margins stay flat. At 13% margins throughout and a 9.0x exit (no re-rating without the thesis):
- Exit EBITDA: ~$2.0B (vs. $2.7B base case)
- Exit TEV: ~$18.0B
- Equity proceeds: ~$12.2B (less cash swept since lower FCF)
- MOIC: ~2.0x | IRR: ~15% — below PE hurdle

**Secondary risk: Floating rate exposure.**

The $9.4B Term Loan B is priced at SOFR + 350bps. The model assumes SOFR at 4.50%. If SOFR moves to 6.00%, annual interest increases by **~$141M**, directly reducing free cash flow and meaningfully slowing debt sweeps. Over 5 years, this compounds into materially higher exit net debt.

**Tertiary risk: Consumer cyclicality.**

DKS is 100% consumer discretionary. A recession compresses traffic and ticket size simultaneously — exactly when fixed-cost leverage is most painful. Mitigant: DKS's post-consolidation market position means even in a downturn they're likely gaining share from smaller independents, which partially offsets volume pressure.

## Q4: Why 5.5x leverage and not 7x?

Two reasons: market reality and deal-specific math.

**Market reality:**
The leveraged loan market has been cautious on consumer retail since 2022. Lenders have seen Sports Authority, Modell's, Tuesday Morning, and Bed Bath & Beyond. Getting 7x underwritten on a big-box retailer — even a dominant one — is a difficult underwrite in the current environment. 5.0–6.0x is the realistic ceiling for consumer retail LBOs.

**Deal-specific math:**

| Leverage | Debt | Year 1 Interest | As % of EBITDA | Year 1 Levered FCF |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.5x | $9.4B | $748M | 44% | ~$355M |
| 7.0x | $11.9B | $952M | 56% | ~$150M |

At 7x leverage, Year 1 interest consumes 56% of EBITDA. Levered FCF drops to ~$150M — a thin margin that disappears entirely in any revenue miss. One bad quarter and you're in a technical covenant conversation with your lenders.

At 5.5x, even before the margin thesis plays out, the business generates ~$355M of levered FCF in Year 1. That's cushion. The deal can absorb a hiccup without triggering a distress situation.

**The principle:** In LBOs, the right leverage level is the one where the business can comfortably service its debt in a *downside* scenario, not just the base case. 7x assumes everything goes right. 5.5x assumes you might have a bad year.

## Q5: What drives sensitivity most — entry multiple, exit multiple, growth, or leverage?

**Rank: Exit multiple > EBITDA margin expansion > Entry multiple > Revenue growth > Leverage**

**Exit multiple is the biggest lever** because it's applied to a *growing* EBITDA base. At exit, every additional turn of multiple is multiplied against **$2.7B of EBITDA**. At entry, every turn is multiplied against $1.7B. The asymmetry compounds over 5 years — the exit base is 58% larger.

A 1-turn move at exit = ~$2.7B of additional enterprise value.
A 1-turn move at entry = ~$1.7B change in TEV, split between debt and equity.

**EBITDA margin is a close second** because it has a *dual impact*: higher margins directly increase exit EBITDA (lifting exit TEV), and higher margins generate more free cash flow during the hold (accelerating debt sweeps and reducing exit net debt). It hits returns from both sides.

**Entry multiple matters less** than most people assume. A 0.5x improvement in entry multiple saves ~$850M in equity at entry — meaningful but not transformational. Compare that to a 1-turn improvement in exit multiple which adds ~$2.7B in exit TEV.

**Revenue growth matters least in isolation** because it needs to be paired with margin maintenance or expansion to translate into EBITDA growth. Top-line growth that compresses margins (e.g., discounting to drive traffic) can actually hurt returns.

**The answer for the sensitivity table:** Look at the 9x/7x cell vs. the 7x/9x cell. Buying at 7x entry vs. 9x entry helps less than selling at 9x exit vs. 7x exit. That's the asymmetry in one comparison.

## Q6: What if EBITDA drops 10%?

**The answer depends entirely on timing — temporary shock vs. permanent impairment.**

**Scenario A: Year 1 revenue miss, EBITDA -10% in Year 1 only, recovers Year 2+**
- Year 1 EBITDA: $1,704M (vs. $1,893M base case)
- Year 1 levered FCF: effectively zero after interest ($748M) and capex (~$473M)
- No cash sweep in Year 1 — TLB stays at $9,256M (mandatory amort only)
- Years 2–5 recover on base case trajectory
- **Impact: IRR falls ~2–3 percentage points. Uncomfortable, not catastrophic.**
- This is the "bad quarter" scenario. You explain it to your LPs as a timing issue.

**Scenario B: Permanent 10% EBITDA haircut across entire hold period**
- Exit EBITDA: $2,686M × 90% = **$2,417M**
- Exit TEV at 10.5x: **$25.4B** (vs. $28.2B base case)
- Less debt sweeps (lower FCF throughout) → net debt at exit: ~**$6.5B**
- Equity proceeds: ~**$18.6B**
- MOIC: **3.1x** | IRR: **~25%** — *still clears the hurdle*

**The deal is surprisingly resilient** to a 10% permanent EBITDA impairment because the margin expansion thesis provides a large buffer above the impairment, and the cash sweep still pays down significant debt even at reduced FCF levels.

**The scenario that breaks the deal:**
EBITDA -10% *and* no margin expansion *and* exit multiple compresses to 8x:
- Exit EBITDA: ~$1,800M
- Exit TEV: ~$14.4B
- Net debt (minimal sweeps): ~$7.8B
- Equity proceeds: ~$6.3B
- MOIC: **1.05x** — essentially a return of capital
- IRR: **~1%** — total loss of return

**The lesson:** Any one of those stress factors alone, the deal survives comfortably. Two of them together starts to hurt. All three simultaneously is the losing scenario — and that's what due diligence is for.
